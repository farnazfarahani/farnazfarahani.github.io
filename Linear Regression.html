        <!--  <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
        <p> The Machine Learning class is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of machine learning. Throughout the course, students will explore various learning paradigms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and dive into key algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning. The objective of the class is to equip students with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary to build and evaluate machine learning models. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems, interpret model outputs, optimize algorithms, and gain insights from data. Additionally, the course will emphasize critical thinking around model limitations, biases, and ethical considerations in AI-driven decision-making.</p>
